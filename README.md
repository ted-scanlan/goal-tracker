### Tuesday 25th June ###


#### Notes for the day: ####

**Debugging workshop:**

 * Bugs (at this stage) can be categorised in 2 seperate ways: the code itself (the code wont run) and the behaviour of the code (i.e. the code works but not in the desired way we want it to)


*  if you want to run only a unit test, i.e. just test a single method, run rspec spec./filename :linenumber



#### Learning objectives for tomorrow: ####

* start on practical work in the morning - LEARN BY DOING

* develop further understanding of testing and Rspec syntax. Make sure i have a good debugging process. i.e. visibility ---- tightening the loop ---- knowing whats wrong before you try to fix it

* able to write tests from scratch of basic programs.

* finish the cipher challenge and understand how it works
